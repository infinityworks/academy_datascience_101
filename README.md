This is a very gentle example to show how a model is trained in SKlearn. If you are part of IW you can access the training materials [here](https://myoffice.accenture.com/:p:/g/personal/rob_mansfield_accenture_com/ERJ0pd5_1MtBjQXSNhEjnbwB5mrn2v-c_Rn6M5cpiVG5fw?e=mlMASc). If you aren't then hit me up for a chat!

If you want to use this for a lesson I'd suggest you load it into [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) as a Git Repo, you can do what you want with it then. 

Final note, if you are changing this notebook and pushing it then please clear code-chunk outputs so the participants have to run it!
